                <h2>Getting There - Trials, Nerves, Victory</h2>
                <p class="gettingThere">
                    Deciding to move to Prague, CZ was the easy part. I
                    had recently graduated from Western State Colorado
                    University in Gunnsion, CO and enjoyed the winter
                    living and working as a ski bum. I was considering
                    going to graduate school or travelling - my travel bug
                    won out. I promptly found a TEFL course (Teaching
                    English as a Foreign Language) and booked a one way
                    ticket to the ancient fairytale city.<br><br>
                    I flew into Amsterdam and had a few hours to marvel in
                    the new land beneath my feet
                    before embarking on my first test of this solo
                    adventure.
                    I had never been to Europe before but had decided that
                    I would rather navigate the train systems rather than
                    fly straight into Prague - because why do things the
                    easy way? The trains don't provide a
                    lot of space to move around and are definitely not
                    ideal for travelling with large luggage. I'm sure I
                    many people had a chuckle as they watched this naive
                    American
                    girl lug two fifty pound suitcases, a backpack,
                    and a yoga mat across three train platforms. I honestly
                    have no idea how I managed to hop on the correct trains
                    but with some help from friendly strangers and sheer
                    stubborness I made it to my new home, Prague.

                <h2>TEFL with The Language House Prague</h2>
                <p class="tefl">
                    Many young Americans who want to travel and work take a
                    TEFL course so that they are able to live and work
                    around the world. The course that I chose was through
                    The Language House Prague. It was an intense month long
                    course and way harder than I imagined. I chose this
                    specific school because they help students get
                    settled into their new life in the city by providing
                    housing during the course and helped students find
                    housing and jobs once they completed the program. They
                    also helps people navigate applying for a work visa
                    and were an overall great support system to have in a
                    foreign land.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I completed the program and had intentions of living
                    and teaching in Prague for one year. When I realized
                    that I would have to work 40-50 hours a week to make
                    ends meet. I didn't cross the Atlantic to work more
                    than I did at home. I wanted to eplore as much as
                    possible and that became my number one priority. I made
                    the decision to cut my
                    trip short so that I could focus on exploring and
                    enjoying life abroad. I tutored a few individuals and
                    families for beer and food money (and to not completely
                    drain my savings) but overall focused on
                    where my next adventure would be.

                            Karl&#353;tejn Castle. The castle was built to
                            hold
                            the crown jewels of Czech king and Roman

                            Charles IV. A hiking trail leads from
                            the castle grounds to Beroun for an entrancing

                <h2>Travelling Mishaps: Almost Thwarted by this Bathroom
                    Stall</h2>
                <p class="travelMishaps">
                    Travel mishaps are something that I managed to mostly
                    avoid or found a way to recover from. <br><br> Nothing
                    compared to the anxiety I felt though when I found
                    myself stuck in a bathroom stall at 5am in Va&#769;clav
                    Havel Airport Prague. The lock was stuck and wouldn't
                    open. No one was around. There was
                    no way I was missing my flight home - I realized that
                    this was the
                    moment I've been unknowingly training for. I managed to
                    slip my luggage under the door and then planned my
                    escape. Bathroom stalls in Europe offer way more
                    privacy than those in the U.S. and so there's not much
                    room under or above the stall. I jumped up to grab the
                    top of the stall, hoisted myself up, and slid myself
                    over the door.<br><br> Now anytime I don't feel like
                    working out or practicing yoga I remind myself that it
                    is necessary to train so that I can escape bathroom
                    stalls in the future.

                            The bathroom stall that perfectly summed up the
                            lessons I learned living abroad. I will
                            stumble, I will fall, but I will always find a
                            way to pick myself up and move foward stronger
                            and wiser.
